Should continue for some time. @LisasNylonLeggs High Tight Flag = HFT 

see how the flag on $BNGO is formed tight and at the top of the flag pole? $MSTR formed a double bottom and reclaimed $950 

Decent set up just bitcoin risk 

$1350 looks realistic. @LoveMakinDough üëç Bearish engulfing on the 15 min $PLTR print spooked buyers.

$37 ish look at $FUTU for clues bot $RIOT against puts $QQQ and $AAPL bounced 

LOD on both would negate this not the worst place to trim $TIGR 

If you were concerned and did not trim at the top of the channel earlier in the week Bot puts on $RIOT here For those that wanted to trim $RIOT and were panicking when it was in the 50s last night
